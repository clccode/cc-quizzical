# Quizzical, a quiz game

This is the "Quizzical" project from the Scrimba (https://scrimba.com) Front End Development Career Path course.  The project uses React to create a quiz game.

* The questions come from the Open Trivia DB (https://opentdb.com/)

A live demo is available here: https://cc-quizzical.netlify.app/
